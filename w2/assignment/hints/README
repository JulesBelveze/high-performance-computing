The current directory contains 3 folders:
- bash_scripts ==> batch scripts written in Unix bash (command line) used to submit jobs to the LSF10 clusters
- src          ==> all the source code (compiled objects and executable file not included!)
- output       ==> all the needed outputs from the batch jobs, used to generate the plots
