The different versions of Jacobi contain the different tuning iterations performed while working on the parallelized version. The main jacobi.c file contains the version that will be compiled!
Change its content accordingly, eventually.

Instructions about how to launch the executable:
1) make
2) poisson {type} {N} {k} {d}
where:
- type: gauss / jacobi
- N: number of INNER grid points (excluding boundaries)
- k: max number of iterations
- d: threshold
